'Nothing like a little entitled narcissism to make your day,' one wrote. Another added: 'Bro, shut up. You’re literally getting these people to pay your mortgage. Landlords have gained the upper hand in the nationwide rental shortage. Pictured are Sydneysiders at a rental inspection Some called for the agent to be named and shamed. 'That is appalling, not just unprofessional, it's a form of harassment to the tenant. Not to mention a big middle finger to the Tribunal,' one commented. Other shared their own rental horror stories. 'I left otherwise good rental as the landlord tried to rebuild with me still paying rent. Middle of winter he removed all the laundry wall exposing me to elements. Then remodelled kitchen and bathroom. ALL WITHOUT NOTICE,' one man recalled. But not everyone was on the tenant's side. 'Tenants now have more rights than owners,' one wrote. Renters have no other choice but to accept below standard living conditions, along with inspections and rent rises without notice.

The 2024 qualifier was originally scheduled for October 15 but was delayed after fighters from the Hamas extremist group – deemed a terrorist organization by the EU and the United States – attacked Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking some 240 people hostage. As halftime approached, Kosovo had taken a 1-0 lead with a goal by Milot Rashica. That Hamas attack fueled relentless Israeli retaliatory strikes against Gaza, leading to more than 11,000 deaths, according to Palestinian officials. Kosovo authorities stepped up security measures after Israeli players arrived on November 10 and added to them as match day approached. Personnel blocked roads around the stadium and carried out strict checks on ticketed fans. Authorities said that \"any racist, xenophobic, political, religious promotional material will be banned.\" The tough security presence and poor weather likely contributed to the smaller-than-expected crowd for the match. Hours before the match, a large banner with the inscription \"Free Palestine\" was placed on the Grand Hotel building in the city center next to a Ukrainian flag by the activist group Collective for Feminist Thought and Action -- but it was quickly removed. Days before the match, a pro-Palestinian group had requested permission for a peaceful protest on the day of the game, but police rejected the request for security reasons. A day before the match, Israel\\'s coach and captain said the Israel national team felt \"safe and comfortable\" in Kosovo. No media source currently available Both sides urged fans to focus on soccer amid the tense geopolitical situation. Kosovo\\'s coach, Primoz Gliha, on November 11 said turmoil over the Israel-Hamas war should not affect this match and that for him, it is not something extraordinary to play football in times of war. “It doesn\\'t affect me. Not at all, because this is life. We had a war in Yugoslavia, we played in similar conditions. But football is football. I am very sad about this [war],\" said Gliha, who played as a professional for Dinamo Zagreb when his homeland, Slovenia, gained independence from the former Yugoslavia in 1991. A Ukrainian delegation led by First Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko and presidential administration chief Andriy Yermak arrived in the United States on November 12 for talks on security, the economy, and \"many other important topics,\" officials said. The delegation “ will have meetings in the White House, Congress, think tanks, [and] with representatives of public organizations,” in a Telegram post. Fugitive pro-Russia Moldovan businessman Ilan Shor, who is accused of \"buying\" voters to sway an election in the ex-Soviet state, has returned to his exile base in Israel, an Interpol official said on November 12. Viorel Tentiu said Shor had returned to Israel by air on November 8, but Israeli officials were unable to say where his flight had originated. \"It\\'s unknown where he went or where he returned from,\" Tentiu told state television. Tentiu had said Shor left Israel on November 6. He was sentenced in absentia to 15 years in prison by a Moldovan court in April over a $1 billion bank fraud. Russia’s Emergency Situations Ministry on November 12 announced the start of the evacuation of Russian citizens from the war-torn Gaza Strip. The ministry said the first Russians had begun through the Rafah border crossing. It added that people crossing will be provided with food and water and be transferred to the Egyptian capital, Cairo. Some 70 Russians have already crossed, the ministry said without specifying how many it expected to eventually handle. After being closed the two previous days, the Rafah crossing was reopened on November 12, with hundreds of people expected to transit, including many with foreign passports. British lawmakers and members of the upper house of Parliament have called on the government to proscribe Iran\\'s Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization, calling it a step toward stability to the Middle East. Proscribing the IRGC would make it a criminal offense to belong to the group, attend its meetings, or carry its logo in public. The IRGC is already subject to British sanctions. In a letter to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, more than 60 lawmakers said \"given the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, it is now more urgent than ever to proscribe the IRGC.\" KYIV -- Ukraine said that \"local resistance\" fighters had in the occupied city of Melitopol, killing at least three officers, as the Kremlin’s troops continued to press attacks in the east and south around the battered cities of Bakhmut and Avdiyivka and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned that the winter ahead could be difficult..

It added that the attack was carried out “during a meeting of officers” of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) and National Guard. The report could not immediately be independently verified. Melitopol -- a city with a prewar population of about 150,000 in the Zaporizhzhya region -- was occupied by Russian troops soon after the Kremlin’s full-scale invasion of February 2022. In his nightly video address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned citizens to be prepared for a difficult winter as Russia steps up its attacks on crucial energy sites, as it did a year ago. \"We must be prepared for the possibility the enemy may increase the number of drone or missile strikes on our infrastructure,\" Zelenskiy said. \"All our attention should be focused on defense, on response to terrorists, on everything Ukraine can do to make it easier for our people to get through this winter and to increase the capabilities of our troops,” . Elsewhere, Ukrainian officials said Russian forces had intensified attacks in the east of the country as they attempt to regain ground near Bakhmut, the devastated city that was the scene of a monthslong battle before falling to the Russians in May. General Oleksandr Syrskiy, the commander of Ukraine\\'s ground forces, that “toward Bakhmut, the Russians have stepped up [attacks] and are trying to recapture previously lost positions.” He added that “enemy attacks are being repelled,” without providing details. Meanwhile, the Defense Ministry in Moscow said Russian forces had thwarted five Ukrainian attacks near Klishchiyivka, Kurdyumivka, and two villages south of Bakhmut over the past day. Bakhmut has been an epicenter of fighting for months as an ambitious Ukrainian counteroffensive has raged on its northern and southern flanks, with Russian forces still in control of the city itself. A Ukrainian ground-forces spokesman, Volodymyr Fityo, said in a television appearance that the Russians were \"probing defenses\" around Bakhmut in hopes of \"trying to storm\" areas under Ukrainian control but hadn\\'t achieved \"strategic success.\" General Oleksandr Tarnavskiy, the Ukrainian commander near Avdiyivka, that Russian forces were stepping up air strikes there with the use of guided bombs. Tarnavskiy added that Russian forces had conducted 30 air strikes and 712 artillery launches at Avdiyivka and nearby areas over the past day, along with carrying out some four dozen direct combat assaults against Ukrainian units. He reported heavy Russian losses in men and materiel, but the report could not be confirmed and there were no details on Ukrainian losses.\\u200b Early on November 12, the head of the regional military administration, Oleksandr Produkin, said an early morning had struck the Honchar Regional Library in Kherson, a center of scientific learning. \"One of the hits was on the Honchar regional library.

Russian officials have denied targeting civilians despite near-constant bombardment and drone attacks on infrastructure and population centers in the 20-month full-scale war. Orthodox priests in at least 13 parishes in Moldova expect to be accepted into the local branch of a Romanian church this week, furthering a trend of dozens of defections from the local arm of the Russian Orthodox Church amid state, clergy, and public anger over Moscow\\'s invasion of Moldova\\'s fellow post-Soviet neighbor Ukraine. Control of the dozen-plus parishes will pass to the Metropolis of Bessarabia, which is subordinate to the Romanian Orthodox Church. The Moscow-run Moldovan Orthodox Church, which serves most Moldovans, has already complained to Moscow\\'s patriarch and defrocked a handful of the defectors. Ukraine will have enough energy resources to get through the coming winter, but an expected surge in Russian attacks may disrupt the supply networks, Ukraine\\'s Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said late on November 11. Halushchenko told Ukrainian public television that \"the question is how much future attacks can affect supplies.\" In the past few weeks, Russia attacked Ukrainian infrastructure 60 times, Kyiv said this week, raising concerns that Moscow may have already started to target the power grid for a second winter at war. Last winter, thousands of Russian drones and missiles hit power infrastructure, causing sweeping blackouts. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz\\'s governing coalition has agreed in principle to double the country\\'s military aid for Ukraine next year to 8 billion euros ($8.5 billion), a political source in Berlin said on November 12. If approved by parliament, where Scholz\\'s parties hold a majority, the boost would lift Germany\\'s defense spending to 2.1 percent of its gross domestic product. Lawmakers from Scholz\\'s Social Democrats, the Free Democrats, and the Greens agreed on the increase during negotiations on the 2024 federal budget ahead of a formal meeting of the budget committee of the Bundestag on November 16, the source said. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused the European Union of attempting to drive his country out of Central Asia, and said the bloc was failing, in an interview broadcast on November 12. Moscow\\'s sway over a region it considers its sphere of influence has waned since the offensive in Ukraine. \"The European Union isn\\'t hiding its intentions to restrain [Russia] in every possible way and push it out of Central Asia and the South Caucasus,\" Lavrov said, adding that these were \"futile\" efforts, and that Russia has been \"historically present there\" and is \"not going to disappear.\" French President Emmanuel Macron last month. Russian police say prosecutors have launched an investigation into popular social media personality Yury Dudy for potentially breaking recent laws enacted to defend the army from criticism after Kremlin war planners ordered the invasion of Ukraine.

Oleksandr Syrskiy, the commander of Ukraine\\'s eastern forces, Russian forces were seeking to \"regain lost positions\" around Bakhmut in the Donetsk region. Bakhmut has been an epicenter of fighting for months as an ambitious Ukrainian counteroffensive has raged on its northern and southern flanks, with Russian forces still in control of the city itself. A Ukrainian ground-forces spokesman, Volodymyr Fityo, said in a televised appearance that the Russians were \"probing defenses\" around Bakhmut in hopes of \"trying to storm\" areas under Ukrainian control but hadn\\'t achieved \"strategic success.\" RFE/RL can\\'t independently confirm battlefield claims by either side in areas of heavy fighting. The Ukrainian General Staff said in its that it had repelled attacks in Andriyivka and other places near Bakhmut, in the Donetsk region, and was waging its own assaults on Russian forces south of the city.

Dilshod Iskandarov is the latest of at least three Uzbeks convicted in the past year under a criminal clause on insulting or slandering the president. Iskandarov allegedly removed the post after relatives warned of its potential risk. Mirziyoev won a new seven-year term in an effectively uncontested vote in July. Belarus\\'s customs body a government document is being prepared that will expand the authority to inspect all postal parcels and other items originating from European Union countries and addressed to Belarusians. Authoritarian leader Alyaksandr Lukashenka announced in September that he had signed a decree to allow for inspections to block the import of aerial drones and prevent their use by individuals amid a yearslong clampdown on the opposition, media, and civil society since a flawed presidential election in 2020. His crackdown has intensified since he allowed Russia to use Belarusian territory for its 20-month-old invasion of Ukraine. Russia plans to block certain Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and protocols which are deemed by a commission of experts to pose a threat, the RIA state news agency reported, citing correspondence from the Digital Ministry. Demand for VPN services soared after Russia restricted access to some Western social media after President Vladimir Putin ordered troops into Ukraine in February 2022. Many VPN services remain widely in use throughout Russia and there has been public debate among lawmakers about how much further to go in blocking VPN services which allow access to banned information but also a host of other information. Latvia’s president says Russia is planning for a long war in Ukraine and he has a message for countries wavering on continuing military support to Kyiv: Keep supplying arms or the Ukrainians will lose and Russia will have a green light for threatening others in the future.

More than 250,000 Afghans have left Pakistan in recent weeks as the government rounded up, arrested, and kicked out foreign nationals without papers. It set an October 31 deadline for migrants without legal status to leave the country voluntarily. The expulsions mostly affect Afghans, who make up the majority of foreigners living in Pakistan. Authorities maintain they are targeting all who are in the country illegally. A decorated officer in the Ukrainian military with \"deep ties\" to the country\\'s intelligence services \"played a central role\" and was the \"coordinator\" of the attack last year on the Nord Stream natural-gas pipeline, The Washington Post on November 11. RFE/RL\\'s gives you all of the latest developments on Russia\\'s full-scale invasion, Kyiv\\'s counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians For all of RFE/RL\\'s coverage of the war in Ukraine, . The report alleged that 48-year-old Special Forces Colonel Roman Chervinskiy \"took orders from more senior Ukrainian officials, who ultimately reported to General Valeriy Zaluzhniy,\" who is Ukraine\\'s top-ranking officer. It quoted Ukrainian and European officials and \"other people knowledgeable about the details of the covert operation.\" The Washington Post said that, through an attorney, Chervinskiy had rejected accusations that he was involved in the sabotage. The explosive charges that were detonated on the pipeline in September 2022 caused massive leaks and were seen as a dangerous attack on European infrastructure a half-year into Russia\\'s full-scale invasion. Western officials initially blamed Russia for the blasts, which all but destroyed the twin pipelines. Moscow blamed the United States and its allies saying it had no reason for blowing up an energy link vital to bringing its supplies westward. Nord Stream is majority-owned by Russia\\'s Gazprom and supplies millions of Europeans with gas. It was seen as a major effort by Moscow to bypass Ukraine in the transit west of Russian gas. The United States had warned for years that the pipelines were a security risk for Germany and other European nations, making the countries’ beholden to Russian energy exports. In July, investigators trying to solve the unexplained blasts that destroyed the Nord Stream pipelines in the Baltic Sea said they had found traces of undersea explosives on a German yacht linked to the incident. The revelations, announced by Danish, German, and Swedish diplomats in a letter dated July 10, were a small but noteworthy development in the continuing mystery of the destruction of the gas pipeline, which occurred September 26, 2022, on the Baltic seabed, east of the Danish island of Bornholm. The explosions were discovered as residual gas bubbled up to the surface. The pipelines were built by Russia to bring its gas directly to Germany, and Europe, bypassing Ukraine, Poland, and other nations that had hostile ties with Moscow. While the first pipeline was operational, the second had not gotten final approval from German regulators. “All speculations about my involvement in the attack on Nord Stream are being spread by Russian propaganda without any basis,” The Washington Post quoted Chervinskiy as saying in a written statement to it and Der Spiegel. There have been further attacks on energy and other infrastructure since the Nord Stream incidents as the 20-month-old invasion has continued. Last month, Finland said it was responsible for more recent damage to the Balticconnector gas pipeline and a telecommunications cable in the Baltic Sea days earlier. Russian authorities said sabotage is suspected after a freight train with 19 wagons derailed early on November 11 in the Ryazan region, injuring at least one member of the rail staff. The news comes on the same day that another suspected sabotage incident was at a Russian munitions factory. Residents in Ryazon told local media that an explosion had been heard shortly before a train carrying fertilizer derailed near Rybnoye, some 200 kilometers southeast of Moscow. Officials said an assistant conductor of the train was injured and is being treated at a hospital. Local authorities the incident occurred at 7:12 a.m. when “an improvised explosive device was detonated,” derailing the train. A number of suspected sabotage cases have been reported in Russia following its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, although details usually are scarce and potential perpetrators are often unknown. The derailment report came on the same day as another suspected sabotage incident took place at a gunpowder factory in Kotovsk in the Tambov region. Witnesses said a fire broke out after an explosion was heard, according to several Russian news outlets’ Telegram channels. The Emergency Situations Ministry of the region confirmed the fire at the factory, saying the blaze broke out in a detached one-story building. No deaths or injuries were reported and the ministry said the fire was being investigated. In June, four people were killed at the Kotovsk factory when an rocked the site. According to the Tambov Gunpowder Plant , the factory \"is one of the largest enterprises in the ammunition and special chemistry industry. It produces pyroxylin powders for all types of weapons, artillery systems of all calibers in service with the Army, Navy, and Air Force.\" Russia has been spreading \"disinformation\" about the situation in the Middle East, the president of Microsoft said on November 11, as tensions soar in the region. Brad Smith was asked about the role of the U.S. tech giant in promoting peace at an international forum in Paris. He said Microsoft and its competitors were fighting against disinformation. \"We are getting very good at identifying a Russian campaign, like when they tried to tell people not to get the COVID vaccine,\" he said. \"Or today, when we see Russian disinformation in the Middle East.\" The mayor’s office of the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk has rejected an application by relatives of mobilized soldiers fighting in Ukraine to hold a demonstration, citing measures instituted to combat the spread of COVID-19. Would-be organizers of the demonstration sought permission for about 30 people to gather in the center of the city on November 19. Organizers said the rejection made no sense, considering that just last week a mass event was held in the city to mark the Day of National Unity holiday. PRISTINA -- Kosovar police said on November 11 that they had stepped up security measures a day before the Euro 2024 qualifying soccer match between Kosovo and Israel, banning materials with religious and political content around and near the stadium in the capital, Pristina. Police officials said they would continue to in the lead up to and after the match, scheduled for November 12. The match at the Fadil Vokrri Stadium is the first for Israel\\'s national team since the war between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas, which has been declared a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union. The match was originally scheduled for October 15 but was postponed after fighters from the extremist group attacked towns in southern Israel, killing around 1,200 people and kidnapping more than 240 others. The attack prompted Israel’s retaliatory military action in the Gaza Strip that has led to more than 11,000 deaths, according to Palestinian authorities. Domestic security forces turned down a request from a pro-Palestinian group in Kosovo -- a country with a Muslim majority -- that sought permission for a peaceful protest on the day of the match. According to Kosovo law, police can prohibit the holding of a public gathering if the purpose of the event is to incite or call for the use of violence, racial, national, ethnic, or religious hatred. Police said they will control possible crowds not only near the stadium, but throughout the city, including its squares. Roads leading to the stadium will be closed on match day as well. Police announced that \"any racist, xenophobic, political, religious promotional material will be banned.\" Fadil Vokrri Stadium, named after the local soccer legend, holds about 14,000 fans. On November 11, both teams held separate news conferences and final practice sessions. Israel\\'s national team said it feels safe and comfortable in Kosovo. Its manager, Alon Hazan, and captain, Eli Dasa, for the welcome. In a Pristina news conference, Hazan described the match as an opportunity to make Israelis back home happy at a difficult time. \"This is not a burden for us. We know what we are representing and we will do everything we can to win this match and bring joy to our people,\" Hazan said \"We feel safe here and we want to appreciate everything the government and all the people in Kosovo have given us with their hospitality,\" Hazan said as he called on the people of Kosovo and Israel to focus only on football. No media source currently available Dasa said he feels \"comfortable\" in Kosovo, adding that \"we are not afraid -- we are people of Israel and we are here to represent our country.\" The captain of Kosovo\\'s national team, Vedat Muriqi, said that “we cannot stop any whistles and protests.” “On the field, we will try to play [soccer]. As for the fans off the field, everyone has their own responsibility.” Kosovo\\'s coach, Primoz Gliha, said the Israel-Hamas war should not affect this match and that for him, it is not something extraordinary to play football in times of war. “It doesn\\'t affect me. Not at all, because this is life. We had a war in Yugoslavia, we played in similar conditions. But football is football. I am very sad about this [war],\" said Gliha, who played as a professional for Dinamo Zagreb when his homeland, Slovenia, gained independence from the former Yugoslavia in 1991. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on November 10 that the U.S. government had seen evidence that Chinese firms may be aiding in the flow of equipment to Russia\\'s war effort despite Western sanctions, and said she had urged China to crack down. Yellen said she raised the issue during two days of meetings with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, expressing concern that equipment \"helpful to Russia\\'s military\" was evading sanctions and getting to Moscow to aid its war against Ukraine. \"I stressed that companies must not provide material support to Russia\\'s defense industrial sector and that they will face significant consequences if they do,\" Yellen told reporters. Staff from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Ukrainian officials reached agreement on an updated set of economic and financial policies for the second review of the four-year Extended Fund Facility to allow disbursement of $900 million in funding, subject to approval by the IMF board. The IMF on November 10 said performance criteria for end-June and indicative targets for end-September were met. “The Ukrainian economy continues to show remarkable resilience, and recent economic developments point to a stronger-than-expected economic recovery in 2023, with continued, albeit softer growth in 2024. However, the outlook remains extremely uncertain as exceptionally high war-related uncertainty persists,” . The Russian Defense Ministry said late on November 10 that air-defense forces had over the territories of the Moscow and Smolensk regions just before midnight.

And what was Sterling\\'s reward for his part in arguably the best result of Chelsea\\'s campaign to date? Narrowly missing out on a poke in the eye as he conducted his post-match press duties. In the Sky Sports reporter Patrick Davidson\\'s defence, they were attempting to remove what was likely a blade of grass from Sterling\\'s eye when things turned awkward. After all, the last thing one expects from a member of the media is to see their digits descending anywhere near one\\'s peeper - even if the winger had been fusing with it throughout the interview. However, Sterling was agile enough to avoid the unwanted aid as he told Davidson he\\'d \\'get more dirt in it\\'. And the reporter quickly retreated before the pair went their separate ways.

His death earlier this month was announced in an obituary this weekend (November 11), which revealed Butler died just two weeks before his 96th birthday. “Robert Stanton Butler, revered television director, loving husband, devoted father and doting grandfather, passed away on November 3 2023 in Los Angeles,” the obituary read. Butler’s career spanned nearly five decades in which he directed many shows including Star Trek , Batman (the original Adam West-starring series), The Dick Van Dyke Show , The Twilight Zone , Hawaii Five-O , Moonlighting and many more. He won three Primetime Emmy Awards during his career – two for The Blue Knight in 1974 and the other for Hill Street Blues in 1981. Butler also co-created Remington Steele , a series which ran from 1982 to 1987 in NBC and gave future Bond star Pierce Brosnan his break. He directed several feature films and television movies too such as Now You See Him, Now You Don’t , The Barefoot Executive , Scandalous John and Disney’s The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes . Robert Butler and Pierce Brosnan – CREDIT: Getty The Directors Guild of America paid tribute to Butler today (November 12). Butler had been a member of the guild since 1959 and was honoured with the Robert B. Aldrich Achievement Award in 2001. DGA president Lesli Linka Glatter said in a statement: “Few directors have changed the face of television as much as Bob did — his impact on the medium is truly immeasurable and this loss to our Guild is deeply felt. At ease in any genre, Bob’s pilots established the look and feel of several seminal series including Hogan’s Heroes , Batman and Star Trek . “His groundbreaking work on Hill Street Blues brought to life the grit and reality of an urban precinct by coupling his unique visual style with evocative performances he coaxed from an incomparable cast, forever changing the trajectory and style of episodic procedurals.” Glatter added: “Bob’s legacy will live on in the memories of the many directors he influenced and mentored, and the countless viewers who laughed and cheered along with his exceptional work. Our deepest condolences to his family and the many Directors and Directorial team members who knew and loved him.” Butler was born on November 16 1927 in Hollywood to an insurance salesman father and an elementary teacher mother. After graduating from school, Butler studied at UCLA, joined the Army Ground Forces Band at the end of WW2. He eventually graduated with a degree in English.

PRISTINA -- The Israeli national soccer team’s match against Kosovo in Pristina kicked off on schedule under tight security before a relatively small crowd at the 14,000-seat Fadil Vokrri Stadium on November 12. The 2024 qualifier was originally scheduled for October 15 but was delayed after fighters from the Hamas extremist group – deemed a terrorist organization by the EU and the United States – attacked Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking some 240 people hostage. As halftime approached, Kosovo had taken a 1-0 lead with a goal by Milot Rashica. That Hamas attack fueled relentless Israeli retaliatory strikes against Gaza, leading to more than 11,000 deaths, according to Palestinian officials. Kosovo authorities stepped up security measures after Israeli players arrived on November 10 and added to them as match day approached. Personnel blocked roads around the stadium and carried out strict checks on ticketed fans. Authorities said that \"any racist, xenophobic, political, religious promotional material will be banned.\" The tough security presence and poor weather likely contributed to the smaller-than-expected crowd for the match. Hours before the match, a large banner with the inscription \"Free Palestine\" was placed on the Grand Hotel building in the city center next to a Ukrainian flag by the activist group Collective for Feminist Thought and Action -- but it was quickly removed. Days before the match, a pro-Palestinian group had requested permission for a peaceful protest on the day of the game, but police rejected the request for security reasons. A day before the match, Israel\\'s coach and captain said the Israel national team felt \"safe and comfortable\" in Kosovo. No media source currently available Both sides urged fans to focus on soccer amid the tense geopolitical situation. Kosovo\\'s coach, Primoz Gliha, on November 11 said turmoil over the Israel-Hamas war should not affect this match and that for him, it is not something extraordinary to play football in times of war. “It doesn\\'t affect me. Not at all, because this is life. We had a war in Yugoslavia, we played in similar conditions. But football is football. I am very sad about this [war],\" said Gliha, who played as a professional for Dinamo Zagreb when his homeland, Slovenia, gained independence from the former Yugoslavia in 1991. Fugitive pro-Russia Moldovan businessman Ilan Shor, who is accused of \"buying\" voters to sway an election in the ex-Soviet state, has returned to his exile base in Israel, an Interpol official said on November 12. Viorel Tentiu said Shor had returned to Israel by air on November 8, but Israeli officials were unable to say where his flight had originated. \"It\\'s unknown where he went or where he returned from,\" Tentiu told state television. Tentiu had said Shor left Israel on November 6. He was sentenced in absentia to 15 years in prison by a Moldovan court in April over a $1 billion bank fraud. Russia’s Emergency Situations Ministry on November 12 announced the start of the evacuation of Russian citizens from the war-torn Gaza Strip. The ministry said the first Russians had begun through the Rafah border crossing. It added that people crossing will be provided with food and water and be transferred to the Egyptian capital, Cairo. Some 70 Russians have already crossed, the ministry said without specifying how many it expected to eventually handle. After being closed the two previous days, the Rafah crossing was reopened on November 12, with hundreds of people expected to transit, including many with foreign passports. British lawmakers and members of the upper house of Parliament have called on the government to proscribe Iran\\'s Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization, calling it a step toward stability to the Middle East. Proscribing the IRGC would make it a criminal offense to belong to the group, attend its meetings, or carry its logo in public. The IRGC is already subject to British sanctions. In a letter to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, more than 60 lawmakers said \"given the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, it is now more urgent than ever to proscribe the IRGC.\" KYIV -- Ukraine said that \"local resistance\" fighters had in the occupied city of Melitopol, killing at least three officers, as the Kremlin’s troops continued to press attacks in the east and south around the battered cities of Bakhmut and Avdiyivka and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned that the winter ahead could be difficult..

It added that the attack was carried out “during a meeting of officers” of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) and National Guard. The report could not immediately be independently verified. Melitopol -- a city with a prewar population of about 150,000 in the Zaporizhzhya region -- was occupied by Russian troops soon after the Kremlin’s full-scale invasion of February 2022. In his nightly video address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned citizens to be prepared for a difficult winter as Russia steps up its attacks on crucial energy sites, as it did a year ago. \"We must be prepared for the possibility the enemy may increase the number of drone or missile strikes on our infrastructure,\" Zelenskiy said. \"All our attention should be focused on defense, on response to terrorists, on everything Ukraine can do to make it easier for our people to get through this winter and to increase the capabilities of our troops,” . Elsewhere, Ukrainian officials said Russian forces had intensified attacks in the east of the country as they attempt to regain ground near Bakhmut, the devastated city that was the scene of a monthslong battle before falling to the Russians in May. General Oleksandr Syrskiy, the commander of Ukraine\\'s ground forces, that “toward Bakhmut, the Russians have stepped up [attacks] and are trying to recapture previously lost positions.” He added that “enemy attacks are being repelled,” without providing details. Meanwhile, the Defense Ministry in Moscow said Russian forces had thwarted five Ukrainian attacks near Klishchiyivka, Kurdyumivka, and two villages south of Bakhmut over the past day. Bakhmut has been an epicenter of fighting for months as an ambitious Ukrainian counteroffensive has raged on its northern and southern flanks, with Russian forces still in control of the city itself. A Ukrainian ground-forces spokesman, Volodymyr Fityo, said in a television appearance that the Russians were \"probing defenses\" around Bakhmut in hopes of \"trying to storm\" areas under Ukrainian control but hadn\\'t achieved \"strategic success.\" General Oleksandr Tarnavskiy, the Ukrainian commander near Avdiyivka, that Russian forces were stepping up air strikes there with the use of guided bombs. Tarnavskiy added that Russian forces had conducted 30 air strikes and 712 artillery launches at Avdiyivka and nearby areas over the past day, along with carrying out some four dozen direct combat assaults against Ukrainian units. He reported heavy Russian losses in men and materiel, but the report could not be confirmed and there were no details on Ukrainian losses.\\u200b Early on November 12, the head of the regional military administration, Oleksandr Produkin, said an early morning had struck the Honchar Regional Library in Kherson, a center of scientific learning. \"One of the hits was on the Honchar regional library. The building is seriously damaged,\" . Prokudin said there were no injuries from the blast or the ensuing fire. Russian officials have denied targeting civilians despite near-constant bombardment and drone attacks on infrastructure and population centers in the 20-month full-scale war. Orthodox priests in at least 13 parishes in Moldova expect to be accepted into the local branch of a Romanian church this week, furthering a trend of dozens of defections from the local arm of the Russian Orthodox Church amid state, clergy, and public anger over Moscow\\'s invasion of Moldova\\'s fellow post-Soviet neighbor Ukraine. Control of the dozen-plus parishes will pass to the Metropolis of Bessarabia, which is subordinate to the Romanian Orthodox Church. The Moscow-run Moldovan Orthodox Church, which serves most Moldovans, has already complained to Moscow\\'s patriarch and defrocked a handful of the defectors. Ukraine will have enough energy resources to get through the coming winter, but an expected surge in Russian attacks may disrupt the supply networks, Ukraine\\'s Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said late on November 11. Halushchenko told Ukrainian public television that \"the question is how much future attacks can affect supplies.\" In the past few weeks, Russia attacked Ukrainian infrastructure 60 times, Kyiv said this week, raising concerns that Moscow may have already started to target the power grid for a second winter at war. Last winter, thousands of Russian drones and missiles hit power infrastructure, causing sweeping blackouts. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz\\'s governing coalition has agreed in principle to double the country\\'s military aid for Ukraine next year to 8 billion euros ($8.5 billion), a political source in Berlin said on November 12. If approved by parliament, where Scholz\\'s parties hold a majority, the boost would lift Germany\\'s defense spending to 2.1 percent of its gross domestic product. Lawmakers from Scholz\\'s Social Democrats, the Free Democrats, and the Greens agreed on the increase during negotiations on the 2024 federal budget ahead of a formal meeting of the budget committee of the Bundestag on November 16, the source said. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused the European Union of attempting to drive his country out of Central Asia, and said the bloc was failing, in an interview broadcast on November 12. Moscow\\'s sway over a region it considers its sphere of influence has waned since the offensive in Ukraine. \"The European Union isn\\'t hiding its intentions to restrain [Russia] in every possible way and push it out of Central Asia and the South Caucasus,\" Lavrov said, adding that these were \"futile\" efforts, and that Russia has been \"historically present there\" and is \"not going to disappear.\" French President Emmanuel Macron last month. Russian police say prosecutors have launched an investigation into popular social media personality Yury Dudy for potentially breaking recent laws enacted to defend the army from criticism after Kremlin war planners ordered the invasion of Ukraine.

The reports came a day after Ukraine marked one year since its forces retook the regional hub of Kherson and with tensions high in Kyiv after the first drone attacks on the Ukrainian capital in nearly two months were said to have been thwarted. Oleksandr Syrskiy, the commander of Ukraine\\'s eastern forces, Russian forces were seeking to \"regain lost positions\" around Bakhmut in the Donetsk region. Bakhmut has been an epicenter of fighting for months as an ambitious Ukrainian counteroffensive has raged on its northern and southern flanks, with Russian forces still in control of the city itself. A Ukrainian ground-forces spokesman, Volodymyr Fityo, said in a televised appearance that the Russians were \"probing defenses\" around Bakhmut in hopes of \"trying to storm\" areas under Ukrainian control but hadn\\'t achieved \"strategic success.\" RFE/RL can\\'t independently confirm battlefield claims by either side in areas of heavy fighting. The Ukrainian General Staff said in its that it had repelled attacks in Andriyivka and other places near Bakhmut, in the Donetsk region, and was waging its own assaults on Russian forces south of the city. Ukrainian sources accuse the Russian side of near-daily attacks on recaptured areas of the Kherson region on the right bank of the Dnieper River. Early on November 12, the head of the regional military administration, Oleksandr Produkin, said an early morning had struck the Honchar Regional Library in Kherson, a center of scientific learning. \"One of the hits was on the Honchar regional library.

A 19-year-old Uzbek man has been sentenced by a Samarkand regional court to 2 1/2 years in prison for insulting President Shavkat Mirziyoev in an Instagram post under a video of the presidential family, some of whom occupy influential or lucrative political and business posts under the clannish regime. Dilshod Iskandarov is the latest of at least three Uzbeks convicted in the past year under a criminal clause on insulting or slandering the president. Iskandarov allegedly removed the post after relatives warned of its potential risk. Mirziyoev won a new seven-year term in an effectively uncontested vote in July. Belarus\\'s customs body a government document is being prepared that will expand the authority to inspect all postal parcels and other items originating from European Union countries and addressed to Belarusians. Authoritarian leader Alyaksandr Lukashenka announced in September that he had signed a decree to allow for inspections to block the import of aerial drones and prevent their use by individuals amid a yearslong clampdown on the opposition, media, and civil society since a flawed presidential election in 2020. His crackdown has intensified since he allowed Russia to use Belarusian territory for its 20-month-old invasion of Ukraine. Russia plans to block certain Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and protocols which are deemed by a commission of experts to pose a threat, the RIA state news agency reported, citing correspondence from the Digital Ministry. Demand for VPN services soared after Russia restricted access to some Western social media after President Vladimir Putin ordered troops into Ukraine in February 2022. Many VPN services remain widely in use throughout Russia and there has been public debate among lawmakers about how much further to go in blocking VPN services which allow access to banned information but also a host of other information. Latvia’s president says Russia is planning for a long war in Ukraine and he has a message for countries wavering on continuing military support to Kyiv: Keep supplying arms or the Ukrainians will lose and Russia will have a green light for threatening others in the future. Edgars Rinkevics said in an interview with the Associated Press that “it is important to actually fight for international peace, and peace in Europe, because if we stop Russia in Ukraine, then Russia is not going to be able to challenge other countries.” Pakistani police are arresting Afghan women and children in southern Sindh Province as part of a government crackdown on migrants, activists said on November 11. More than 250,000 Afghans have left Pakistan in recent weeks as the government rounded up, arrested, and kicked out foreign nationals without papers. It set an October 31 deadline for migrants without legal status to leave the country voluntarily. The expulsions mostly affect Afghans, who make up the majority of foreigners living in Pakistan. Authorities maintain they are targeting all who are in the country illegally. A decorated officer in the Ukrainian military with \"deep ties\" to the country\\'s intelligence services \"played a central role\" and was the \"coordinator\" of the attack last year on the Nord Stream natural-gas pipeline, The Washington Post on November 11. RFE/RL\\'s gives you all of the latest developments on Russia\\'s full-scale invasion, Kyiv\\'s counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians For all of RFE/RL\\'s coverage of the war in Ukraine, . The report alleged that 48-year-old Special Forces Colonel Roman Chervinskiy \"took orders from more senior Ukrainian officials, who ultimately reported to General Valeriy Zaluzhniy,\" who is Ukraine\\'s top-ranking officer. It quoted Ukrainian and European officials and \"other people knowledgeable about the details of the covert operation.\" The Washington Post said that, through an attorney, Chervinskiy had rejected accusations that he was involved in the sabotage. The explosive charges that were detonated on the pipeline in September 2022 caused massive leaks and were seen as a dangerous attack on European infrastructure a half-year into Russia\\'s full-scale invasion. Western officials initially blamed Russia for the blasts, which all but destroyed the twin pipelines. Moscow blamed the United States and its allies saying it had no reason for blowing up an energy link vital to bringing its supplies westward. Nord Stream is majority-owned by Russia\\'s Gazprom and supplies millions of Europeans with gas. It was seen as a major effort by Moscow to bypass Ukraine in the transit west of Russian gas. The United States had warned for years that the pipelines were a security risk for Germany and other European nations, making the countries’ beholden to Russian energy exports. In July, investigators trying to solve the unexplained blasts that destroyed the Nord Stream pipelines in the Baltic Sea said they had found traces of undersea explosives on a German yacht linked to the incident. The revelations, announced by Danish, German, and Swedish diplomats in a letter dated July 10, were a small but noteworthy development in the continuing mystery of the destruction of the gas pipeline, which occurred September 26, 2022, on the Baltic seabed, east of the Danish island of Bornholm. The explosions were discovered as residual gas bubbled up to the surface. The pipelines were built by Russia to bring its gas directly to Germany, and Europe, bypassing Ukraine, Poland, and other nations that had hostile ties with Moscow. While the first pipeline was operational, the second had not gotten final approval from German regulators. “All speculations about my involvement in the attack on Nord Stream are being spread by Russian propaganda without any basis,” The Washington Post quoted Chervinskiy as saying in a written statement to it and Der Spiegel. There have been further attacks on energy and other infrastructure since the Nord Stream incidents as the 20-month-old invasion has continued. Last month, Finland said it was responsible for more recent damage to the Balticconnector gas pipeline and a telecommunications cable in the Baltic Sea days earlier. Russian authorities said sabotage is suspected after a freight train with 19 wagons derailed early on November 11 in the Ryazan region, injuring at least one member of the rail staff. The news comes on the same day that another suspected sabotage incident was at a Russian munitions factory. Residents in Ryazon told local media that an explosion had been heard shortly before a train carrying fertilizer derailed near Rybnoye, some 200 kilometers southeast of Moscow. Officials said an assistant conductor of the train was injured and is being treated at a hospital. Local authorities the incident occurred at 7:12 a.m. when “an improvised explosive device was detonated,” derailing the train. A number of suspected sabotage cases have been reported in Russia following its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, although details usually are scarce and potential perpetrators are often unknown. The derailment report came on the same day as another suspected sabotage incident took place at a gunpowder factory in Kotovsk in the Tambov region. Witnesses said a fire broke out after an explosion was heard, according to several Russian news outlets’ Telegram channels. The Emergency Situations Ministry of the region confirmed the fire at the factory, saying the blaze broke out in a detached one-story building. No deaths or injuries were reported and the ministry said the fire was being investigated. In June, four people were killed at the Kotovsk factory when an rocked the site. According to the Tambov Gunpowder Plant , the factory \"is one of the largest enterprises in the ammunition and special chemistry industry. It produces pyroxylin powders for all types of weapons, artillery systems of all calibers in service with the Army, Navy, and Air Force.\" Russia has been spreading \"disinformation\" about the situation in the Middle East, the president of Microsoft said on November 11, as tensions soar in the region. Brad Smith was asked about the role of the U.S. tech giant in promoting peace at an international forum in Paris. He said Microsoft and its competitors were fighting against disinformation. \"We are getting very good at identifying a Russian campaign, like when they tried to tell people not to get the COVID vaccine,\" he said. \"Or today, when we see Russian disinformation in the Middle East.\" The mayor’s office of the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk has rejected an application by relatives of mobilized soldiers fighting in Ukraine to hold a demonstration, citing measures instituted to combat the spread of COVID-19. Would-be organizers of the demonstration sought permission for about 30 people to gather in the center of the city on November 19. Organizers said the rejection made no sense, considering that just last week a mass event was held in the city to mark the Day of National Unity holiday. PRISTINA -- Kosovar police said on November 11 that they had stepped up security measures a day before the Euro 2024 qualifying soccer match between Kosovo and Israel, banning materials with religious and political content around and near the stadium in the capital, Pristina. Police officials said they would continue to in the lead up to and after the match, scheduled for November 12. The match at the Fadil Vokrri Stadium is the first for Israel\\'s national team since the war between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas, which has been declared a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union. The match was originally scheduled for October 15 but was postponed after fighters from the extremist group attacked towns in southern Israel, killing around 1,200 people and kidnapping more than 240 others. The attack prompted Israel’s retaliatory military action in the Gaza Strip that has led to more than 11,000 deaths, according to Palestinian authorities. Domestic security forces turned down a request from a pro-Palestinian group in Kosovo -- a country with a Muslim majority -- that sought permission for a peaceful protest on the day of the match. According to Kosovo law, police can prohibit the holding of a public gathering if the purpose of the event is to incite or call for the use of violence, racial, national, ethnic, or religious hatred. Police said they will control possible crowds not only near the stadium, but throughout the city, including its squares. Roads leading to the stadium will be closed on match day as well. Police announced that \"any racist, xenophobic, political, religious promotional material will be banned.\" Fadil Vokrri Stadium, named after the local soccer legend, holds about 14,000 fans. On November 11, both teams held separate news conferences and final practice sessions. Israel\\'s national team said it feels safe and comfortable in Kosovo. Its manager, Alon Hazan, and captain, Eli Dasa, for the welcome. In a Pristina news conference, Hazan described the match as an opportunity to make Israelis back home happy at a difficult time. \"This is not a burden for us. We know what we are representing and we will do everything we can to win this match and bring joy to our people,\" Hazan said \"We feel safe here and we want to appreciate everything the government and all the people in Kosovo have given us with their hospitality,\" Hazan said as he called on the people of Kosovo and Israel to focus only on football. No media source currently available Dasa said he feels \"comfortable\" in Kosovo, adding that \"we are not afraid -- we are people of Israel and we are here to represent our country.\" The captain of Kosovo\\'s national team, Vedat Muriqi, said that “we cannot stop any whistles and protests.” “On the field, we will try to play [soccer]. As for the fans off the field, everyone has their own responsibility.” Kosovo\\'s coach, Primoz Gliha, said the Israel-Hamas war should not affect this match and that for him, it is not something extraordinary to play football in times of war. “It doesn\\'t affect me. Not at all, because this is life. We had a war in Yugoslavia, we played in similar conditions. But football is football. I am very sad about this [war],\" said Gliha, who played as a professional for Dinamo Zagreb when his homeland, Slovenia, gained independence from the former Yugoslavia in 1991. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on November 10 that the U.S. government had seen evidence that Chinese firms may be aiding in the flow of equipment to Russia\\'s war effort despite Western sanctions, and said she had urged China to crack down. Yellen said she raised the issue during two days of meetings with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, expressing concern that equipment \"helpful to Russia\\'s military\" was evading sanctions and getting to Moscow to aid its war against Ukraine. \"I stressed that companies must not provide material support to Russia\\'s defense industrial sector and that they will face significant consequences if they do,\" Yellen told reporters. Staff from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Ukrainian officials reached agreement on an updated set of economic and financial policies for the second review of the four-year Extended Fund Facility to allow disbursement of $900 million in funding, subject to approval by the IMF board. The IMF on November 10 said performance criteria for end-June and indicative targets for end-September were met. “The Ukrainian economy continues to show remarkable resilience, and recent economic developments point to a stronger-than-expected economic recovery in 2023, with continued, albeit softer growth in 2024. However, the outlook remains extremely uncertain as exceptionally high war-related uncertainty persists,” . The Russian Defense Ministry said late on November 10 that air-defense forces had over the territories of the Moscow and Smolensk regions just before midnight. Details remained scarce and it was not possible to immediately confirm the report.

(Nasdaq: LXRX) today announced that a post hoc analysis of clinical data from the SCORED trial demonstrated that clinical benefit from INPEFA ® (sotagliflozin) use in heart failure (HF) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) related outcomes was observed as early as approximately three months in patients at high risk for cardiovascular events. The data were shared in an oral presentation by Rahul Aggarwal, M.D., Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, at the American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions 2023 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The goal of the analysis was to evaluate the time to clinical benefit for HF and MACE related outcomes in patients at high risk for cardiovascular events and treated with sotagliflozin. For total cardiovascular deaths, hospitalizations for HF, or urgent visits for HF, the primary endpoint of the trial, the relative risk reduction observed in patients treated with sotagliflozin vs. placebo was 26% (HR=0.74; 95% CI, 0.63, 0.88; p<0.001). A statistically significant sustained reduction in the primary endpoint was seen at 95 days after randomization (HR=0.70; 95% CI: 0.50, 0.98). For MACE, a predefined secondary endpoint of the trial, the relative risk reduction observed in patients treated with sotagliflozin vs. placebo was 23% (HR=0.77; 95% CI, 0.65, 0.91; p<0.001). A statistically significant sustained reduction in MACE was seen at 94 days after randomization (HR=0.69; 95% CI: 0.47, 0.99). During the Scientific Sessions, researchers also presented data from Lexicon-supported studies relating to INPEFA’s mechanism of action and pharmacoeconomic analyses of INPEFA use, as well as real world evidence for patients hospitalized with heart failure. “We are pleased to support research in areas important to heart failure clinicians and payors, and we are confident that the early clinical benefit of INPEFA observed in the SCORED post hoc analysis will play a role in care decisions made by these stakeholders,” said Craig Granowitz, M.D., Ph.D., Lexicon’s senior vice president and chief medical officer. “Avoiding a stroke or myocardial infarction can have great benefit to both patients and the healthcare system, and we believe that the observed reductions in MACE as early as approximately three months are additional points of differentiation for INPEFA.” On May 26, 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved INPEFA ® (sotagliflozin), a once-daily oral tablet, to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, and urgent heart failure visit in adults with: heart failure or type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and other cardiovascular risk factors.

For additional information, please visit www.lexpharma.com . About INPEFA ® (sotagliflozin) Discovered using Lexicon’s unique approach to gene science, INPEFA ® (sotagliflozin) is an oral inhibitor of two proteins responsible for glucose regulation known as sodium-glucose cotransporter types 2 and 1 (SGLT2 and SGLT1). SGLT2 is responsible for glucose reabsorption by the kidney and SGLT1 is responsible for glucose absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. INPEFA has been studied in multiple patient populations encompassing heart failure, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease in clinical studies involving approximately 20,000 patients. INDICATION INPEFA is indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, and urgent heart failure visit in adults with: heart failure or type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and other cardiovascular risk factors IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION Dosing: Assess renal function and volume status and, if necessary, correct volume depletion prior to initiation of INPEFA. INPEFA dosing for patients with decompensated heart failure may begin when patients are hemodynamically stable, including when hospitalized or immediately upon discharge. Contraindications: INPEFA is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any component. Warnings and Precautions: Ketoacidosis: INPEFA increases the risk of ketoacidosis in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and pancreatic disorders are also risk factors. The risk of ketoacidosis may be greater with higher doses. There have been postmarketing reports of fatal events of ketoacidosis in patients with type 2 diabetes using sodium glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. Before initiating INPEFA, assess risk factors for ketoacidosis. Consider ketone monitoring in patients with T1DM and consider ketone monitoring in others at risk for ketoacidosis, and educate patients on the signs/symptoms of ketoacidosis. Patients receiving INPEFA may require monitoring and temporary discontinuation of therapy in clinical situations known to predispose to ketoacidosis. Assess patients who present with signs and symptoms of metabolic acidosis or ketoacidosis, regardless of blood glucose level. If suspected, discontinue INPEFA, evaluate, and treat promptly. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting INPEFA. Volume Depletion: INPEFA can cause intravascular volume depletion which may sometimes manifest as symptomatic hypotension or acute transient changes in creatinine. There have been post-marketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors. Patients with impaired renal function (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), elderly patients, or patients on loop diuretics may be at increased risk for volume depletion or hypotension. Before initiating INPEFA in patients with one or more of these characteristics, assess volume status and renal function, and monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension during therapy. Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis: Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors, including INPEFA, increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Serious urinary tract infections including urosepsis and pyelonephritis requiring hospitalization have been reported. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly. Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues: Insulin and insulin secretagogues are known to cause hypoglycemia. INPEFA may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used with INPEFA. Necrotizing Fasciitis of the Perineum (Fournier’s Gangrene): Reports of Fournier’s Gangrene, a rare but serious and life-threatening necrotizing infection requiring urgent surgical intervention, have been identified in post-marketing surveillance in patients with diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors. Assess patients who present with pain, tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, along with fever or malaise. If suspected, start treatment immediately with broad-spectrum antibiotics and, if necessary, surgical debridement. Discontinue INPEFA, closely monitor patient signs and symptoms, and provide appropriate alternative therapy for heart failure. Genital Mycotic Infections: INPEFA increases the risk of genital mycotic infections. Monitor and treat as appropriate. Urinary Glucose Test and 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) Assay: these are not reliable for patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. Use alternative testing methods to monitor glucose levels. Common Adverse Reactions: the most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 5%) were urinary tract infection, volume depletion, diarrhea, and hypoglycemia. Drug Interactions: Digoxin: Monitor patients appropriately as there is an increase in the exposure of digoxin when coadministered with INPEFA 400 mg. Uridine 5′-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) Inducer: The coadministration of rifampicin, an inducer of UGTs, with sotagliflozin resulted in a decrease in the exposure of sotagliflozin. Lithium: Concomitant use of an SGLT2 inhibitor with lithium may decrease serum lithium concentrations. Monitor serum lithium concentration more frequently during INPEFA initiation and with dosage changes. Use in Specific Populations: Pregnancy and Lactation: INPEFA is not recommended during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, nor while breastfeeding. Geriatric Use: No INPEFA dosage change is recommended based on age. No overall differences in efficacy were detected between these patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Elderly patients may be at increased risk for volume depletion adverse reactions, including hypotension. Renal Impairment: INPEFA was evaluated in patients with chronic kidney disease (eGFR 25 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) and in patients with heart failure with eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . The safety profile of INPEFA across eGFR subgroups in these studies was consistent with the known safety profile. There was an increase in volume-related adverse events (e.g., hypotension, dizziness) in patients with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m 2 relative to the overall safety population. Efficacy and safety studies with INPEFA did not enroll patients with an eGFR less than 25 mL/min/1.73 m2 or on dialysis. After starting therapy in the studies, patients were discontinued if eGFR fell below 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 or were initiated on chronic dialysis. Hepatic Impairment: INPEFA is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Click here for full Prescribing Information. About the SCORED Study SCORED was a multi-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study evaluating the cardiovascular efficacy of sotagliflozin versus placebo when added to standard of care in 10,584 patients with type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease with eGFR of 25 ml to 60 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area, and risks for cardiovascular disease. The primary endpoint was the total number of events comprised of deaths from cardiovascular causes, hospitalizations for heart failure, and urgent visits for heart failure in patients treated with sotagliflozin compared with placebo. Key secondary endpoints included total number of events of deaths from cardiovascular causes, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke. SCORED achieved its primary endpoint, with overall tolerability similar to placebo. Results were presented at the Late-Breaking Science Session of the American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions 2020 and simultaneously published in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) in an article titled: “Sotagliflozin in Patients with Diabetes and Chronic Kidney Disease.” Safe Harbor Statement This press release contains “forward-looking statements,” including statements relating to the therapeutic and commercial potential, research and clinical development and regulatory status of INPEFA ® (sotagliflozin).

Oh, just the sound of hearts breaking everywhere because, yes, the rumours are true… Harry Styles has shaved his head. Following intense speculation and some grainy pictures over recent days, the One Direction star’s mother, Anne Twist, has confirmed the shocking news that the curly-haired pop star now has a buzzcut. Her confirmation comes after Harry, 29, was spotted living it up with girlfriend Taylor Russell, also 29, at U2’s concert at The Sphere in Las Vegas earlier this week. The word ‘unrecognisable’ gets thrown about a lot, but in this instance, Hazza really did look worlds away from his usual self, as his unruly chocolate locks were no more. Fans have been going wild since the images found their way to the internet, wondering why on Earth the Grammy winner would want to buzz off his world-famous curls. Well, we have an answer thanks to his mum Anne and the fan who randomly met her in Ikea. Harry shaved his head because â\\x80\\x9cheâ\\x80\\x99s on holiday and fancied a changeâ\\x80\\x9d according to a fan who met Anne today! (via madelin_elise) pic.twitter.com/QabECIH5s5 Taking to TikTok, the overjoyed fan posted a video, detailing her encounter with Harry’s mum. The young woman said she ‘couldn’t stop crying’ when she realised Anne was there, asking her for a photo and telling her what a huge Harry lover she is. She then plucked up the courage to ask: ‘Has Harry shaved his head?’ Anne said: ‘Yes’, much to the fan’s shock. ‘This woman confirmed that Harry Styles has shaved his head!’, she repeated in her TikTok, utterly stunned. She recalled: ‘I didn’t know what to do with this information. ‘Not only have I met the love of my life’s mother, she then tells me that he’s shaved his head!’ ‘My dad then said, “Is it for a film or is it just for a change?”,’ the fan added. Harry Styles takes big next step with girlfriend Taylor Russell Fans in mourning after Harry Styles 'spotted with a shaved head' Louis Tomlinson addresses rumours he had relationship with Harry Styles Anne’s response was: ‘It’s because he’s on holiday, he fancied a change.’ So, there we have it, folks! We ask that you please respect our privacy at this time… It’s understandable why Harry’s image transformation is a shock to us all, as he’s had curls since he burst onto our TV screens at just 16 when he auditioned for The X Factor. His hair has seen plenty of styles over the last 13 years, including a quiff from 2013, 2014’s affectionately dubbed ‘Prince Hair Harry’ era, and not forgetting his longest locks of all from 2015, which he eventually chopped off when he went solo and donated them to charity. From 2016 onwards, Harry has had much shorter hair, never quite growing it back to the length he had in his 1D days. And while his tresses do seem to grow quickly, well, it might be a while before fans see him with a full head of hair again… Harry is, indeed, on his hols and taking a well-deserved break following two years on the road with his majorly successful Love On Tour shows. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video After wrapping up his tour in Europe in July, Harry has been seen with new lover Taylor on numerous occasions, his first relationship since splitting from Olivia Wilde. Ever the supportive boyfriend, Harry was previously seen cheering Taylor on in her theatre debut in The Effect, just as she had been spotted dancing away in the crowd at his gigs. They’ve also been captured holding hands, cuddling, and showing no desire to hide the fact that they are an item. Got a story?

The adventure reality show saw Joel jet off to a desert island in the Dominican Republic for filming, away from his other half, Hannah Cooper. The 38-year-old star has been married to Hannah, a model and fellow podcast host, since 2019 and they welcomed their son, Wilde Cooper-Dommett, in September of this year. The couple live in an incredible house in southwest London, which has a plush cinema room, contemporary kitchen, home gym and Love Island-style back garden.

Opening up to the Mirror about first-time fatherhood, Joel said last month: \"It\\'s amazing, it\\'s everything everyone says it will be and more. Nothing can prepare you for it. But we\\'re very happy as our new little family and Hannah has been beyond amazing.\" The comedian has formed closed friendships with other celebs in the media eye, including Holly Willoughby, Emma Willis and Davina McCall , and is calling on them for parenting advice. He said: \"I hope I\\'m going to be a good dad. Holly Willoughby gave me some lovely advice and said, \\'All you\\'ve got to do is love them\\'. And I think that\\'s the best advice you can have really. \"Davina\\'s going to be great for advice too,\" he continued. \"I think she\\'s going to go hang out with Hannah and honestly... I feel like I\\'ve got a really lovely sort of little television support network around me that I can call for help.\" The pair were congratulated by friends when they announced the birth of Wilde on Instagram, with Ant and Dec and Laura Whitmore sending them well wishes. Their incredible southwest London home has a plush cinema room and home gym ( Image: instagram.com/joeldommett) Joel and Hannah first spoke over Instagram, when Hannah drunkenly messaged Joel with a cat emoji back in 2016. Sparks flew and the duo began dating soon after. They were pictured together for the first time in May 2017, and Joel popped the question to Hannah at the end of his book - though he got her to read the entire thing within a week and ripped the last page out. \"She came home and I read out the last page on one knee, in our flat, candles everywhere, I was in a tux - sweating,\" he explained to the Mirror. \"The best bit was I put on a classical playlist and it was bumming me out a bit, so just before she got home I put on a soundtrack list on Spotify. Just as I was going down on one knee, the Jurassic Park theme tune came on, so I proposed to Jurassic Park.\" The couple got married in Mykonos, Greece , four years ago and Joel said it was the \\'best day of his life\\'. Speaking to OK! in 2020, he said: \"I was fully prepared to say it was the best day of my life and pretend it was - because I\\'ve been lucky enough to do Bake Off and I\\'ve had these amazing experiences in my life - but it was genuinely the best day of my life!\" Joel and Hannah met in 2016 after she slid into his DMs with a cat emoji ( Image: Instagram) The couple witnessed a burglar breaking into their house on CCTV in 2021 ( Image: Dave Benett/ Getty Images) In early 2021, he revealed the nicknames they have for one another in an interview with The Sun. \"A lot of people call their wives \\'babe\\' or \\'chick\\'. I go for Sexy Sexpot of Sex. But her nickname for me is just Joel. That\\'s as far as it goes,\" he said. That same year, he opened up about their house being burgled as they terrifyingly watched a man break in through a window on CCTV. \"After we got married, we finally moved to a new house. We got burgled fairly shortly after we moved in. It was mad,\" he said in a comedy routine. \"It is everyone\\'s worst fear and it was horrible. We saw on our CCTV camera this guy in our garden, and luckily me and her weren\\'t in the house, but we saw it and rang the police and drove home. \"It was mad as we saw on the cameras the police arrive and we weren’t sure if the guy had left. We arrived and the police had gone in through the smashed French window and the guy was in there for 15 minutes. He was getting shoes and handbags and putting them back in boxes.
