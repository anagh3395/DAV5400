ANALYTICS PROGRAMMING 

Code-based solutions can be richer, more accurate, and more flexible than those that rely on  off-the-shelf software and analytic packages. 
This course teaches the programming skills that  data analysts need to prepare structured and unstructured data for downstream analysis.  
Use high-level programming languages to create rich data analysis  workflows. 

COURSE LEARNING OUTCOMES 

∙ Write programs to clean, filter, aggregate, restructure, and combine data. ∙ Load data from both structured and unstructured sources. 

∙ Perform basic exploratory data analysis. 

∙ Apply principles of scientific method and reproducible reporting to the development  and presentation of code-based solutions. 

∙ Create high quality explanatory narratives and visualizations in support of reproducible  analytical work
